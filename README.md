# Connected Life Activity Recognition using G9 Watch Sensor Data

This repo consists of code for the algorithm that distinguishes / recognizes 6 types of human activities using acceleration and rotational acceleration data generated by a smart watch worn on wrist of a user. I compare several machine learning (ML) algorithms performance which are trained on the data collected. Two main approaches considered in this project  are Classical ML Models(e.g. SVM and Logistic Regression) and Deep Learning Models. In Classical ML models, extracted discriminative features from raw input sequences  are used for training, on the other hand for Deep Learning (DL) Models has been trained on raw data. Except from preprocessing for feature extraction, I took moving average of the probabilities of each class as the decisive criteria performs an overall accuracy rate of 88\% in leave one subject out cross-validation(LOSO-CV).
